# Description

- To make life easier after creating a application this app generates the user input and creates a professional README.md
- This app was created to provide a professional formated README.md file for the user
- During the completion of this application an error appeared on the terminal which provided detailed infromation on how to fix the issue. (log was undefined)
- Overall I learned how to create a README file using Node.js. In addition during the poccess I learned how to properly google an error if I am not sure how to debug the code.
